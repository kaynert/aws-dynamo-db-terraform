# aws-dynamo-db-terraform
This project is an assignment given by the Azubi team test our skills on AWS DynamoDB and Terraform. Terraform was used to provision the dynamodb resources for the app

## Technologies Used
**AWS DynamoDB** 
-Terraform
-Docker

### Docker
The app can be tested locally by running a docker container.
**The image can be pulled from docker hub with this command: docker image pull kofihervie/docker-web-app:3.0**

### AWS DynamoDb 
An IAM role granting privileges to the IAM user for dynamo had to be created. This was the most important step before provisioning resources with Terraform.

### Terraform 
Terraform is an Infrastructure-As-Code platform used to provision resources on cloud platforms.
